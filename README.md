This is our last project as a student at ALX.
In this project we created an ecommerce website for the sale of perfumes, watches and other items. The website features various sections with detailed product information. The website provides a user-friendly capability to shop online. Easy-to-navigate product categories will enable customers to quickly find desired items. This project is made by using HTML,CSS,JAVA SCRIPT and REACT JS.

The Team members are Helen Tsegay,Lidya Yonas And Natan Mesele
We hope all of you enjoy it!
We have a plan to create an app for it and you will find the app here when its done.
